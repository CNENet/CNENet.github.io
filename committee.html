        <p>Finn is an avowed generalist who embraces Robert Heinlein’s maxim that ‘specialisation is for insects’. They are naturally curious and willing to look past assumptions in order to be alongside people. Throughout their life they have supported people through times of crisis and uncertainty.</p>

<p>Finn’s key area of interest is supporting nurses and midwives in transition between levels of practice. They contribute to cancer policy, international education programmes and advanced communication skills training. They have taught and continue to learn from nurses in Palestine and Tanzania.</p>
